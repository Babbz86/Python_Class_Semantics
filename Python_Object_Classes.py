# Python Classes
# Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. 
# Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new 
# instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have 
# attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. 
# Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) 
# for modifying its state.
# The simplest form of class definition looks like this:

class ClassName:
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>

# Class definitions, like function definitions (def statements) must be executed before they have any effect. 
# (You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an if statement, or inside a function.)
# The statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, 
# and sometimes useful — we’ll come back to this later.
